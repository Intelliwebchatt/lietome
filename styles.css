      <h2>About Intellichatt</h2>
      <p>
        Intellichatt is an advanced AI tool designed to help you detect deception in written messages.
        Based on scientific principles and powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence, this beta app
        lets you copy and paste any text or message you want to check.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app analyzes your message to identify parts that might indicate deception, provides a percentage
        representing the likelihood of deception, and explains its reasoning. It even suggests follow-up questions
        to ask, allowing you to repeat the process with Intellichatt to improve the accuracy of its analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, Intellichatt is here to help you determine the truth, guiding you to better recognize deception
        and teaching you valuable skills along the way.
